```{r}
# step 1) express each direction in the sample as a set of three direction cosines. If the data are in the form of trend and plunge, the formulae are:
## l=cos(plunge)*cos(trend)
l <- c(cos(plunge)*cos(bearing))
## m=cos(plunge)*sin(trend)
m <- c(cos(plunge)*sin(bearing))
## n=sin(plunge)
n <- c(sin(plunge))
# step 2) and 3) compute the products of each direction-cosine set. sum the products over the whole data sample to give the orientation tensor
b <- matrix(c(
  sum(l^2),sum(l*m),sum(l*n),
  sum(m*l),sum(m^2),sum(m*n),
  sum(n*l),sum(n*m),sum(n^2)),
  ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
# step 4) compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of this matrix
## the eigenvectors (v1,v2,v3) of this matrix correspond to three orthogonal 'principal axes' of the data sample. Axis v1 is an estimate of the mean direction of the data; v3 is the pole to any girdle present in the data [@Watson1966]
eigenvectors <- eigen(b)$vectors
dimnames(eigenvectors) <- list(c("v1","v2","v3"),c("l","m","n"))
## The eigenvalues (λ1,λ2,λ3), associated with (v1,v2,v3) respectively, describe the shape of the data sample [@Watson1966; @Mark1974; @Woodcock1973; @Woodcock1977]
eigenvalues <- eigen(b)$values
names(eigenvalues) <- c("λ1","λ2","λ3")
```

# step 5) compute the eigenvalue ratio, particularly the ratio of the largest to smallest eigenvalue (S1/S3=λ1/λ3)
## since λ1+λ2+λ3=N then normalized eigenvalues Sj=λj/N are related by S1+S2+S3=1. A data cluster has S1>S2~=S3 and a data girdle has S1~=S2>S3
s1 <- eigenvalues["λ1"]/length(plunge)
s2 <- eigenvalues["λ2"]/length(plunge)
s3 <- eigenvalues["λ3"]/length(plunge)
s1_s2 <- s1/s2
s2_s3 <- s2/s3

## complementary to the shape parameter is the parameter C=ln(S1/S3) which expresses the 'strength' of the preferred orientation in the data sample [@Woodcock1977]. Strongly organized samples have larger C and plot further from the origin of the ratio graph. A perfect uniform distribution of data would have C=0 and would plot at the origin with S1=S2=S3=1/3. Random samples will also plot close to the origin and have low C values, suggesting that this parameter might be used as a test statistic for randomness

```{r}
# step 6) refer to Fig.9 or Table 1 and read off the critical S1/S3 value for the appropriate sample size and required confidence level. Note that for a small sample size a 95% confidence level is appropriate
## for N=300 the S1/S3 critical value at 95% confidence level is: 1.34
## for N=282?
# step 7) if the computed value is _less_ than the test value, the data sample cannot be distinguished from a random sample at this confidence level
```

The C value (`r log(s1_s3)`) is higher than the critical S1/S3 test value () for N=282 at 95% confidence, thus the data sample reject the hypothesis of randomness in favor of a strong organized sample (fig.5). The K value (`r log(s1_s2)/log(s2_s3)`) plots the data sample close to K=0, indicating uniaxial girdles (planar fabric).

## Discussion

> One problem in applying the S1/S3 test is that the eigenvector method cannot cope adeguately with certain types of multimodal data [@Woodcock1977]. For this reason the test, as with most other tests reviewed here, could wrongly return a random result from a dataset consisting of several individually significant modes or superimposed samples. [...] For this reason we recommended inspectiong the form of the data on an equal-area plot before accepting the results of any randomness test. If several modes appear to be present then some independent test for multimodality [e.g. @Bailey1975] should be made, together with some attempt to separate data from the various modes [@Kohlbeck&Scheidegger1977] before proceeding further [@Woodcock1983,p.548].
